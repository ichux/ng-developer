# We have a csv file with columns:
# msisdn, session_id, session_start_time, session_end_time, short_code, dialled_string
# session_start_time and session_end_time are dates formatted '[YEAR][MONTH][DAY][HOUR][MINUTE][SECOND]'
# A session is 20 seconds.
# Round up the session to the nearest 20 seconds (e.g. 21 seconds = 2 sessions)

# 1. We want a summary of this file in csv with columns:
#        Short-code, Number-of-sessions

# 2. We want to find out how many sessions in total are 
#      a) Airtime purchases
#      b) Account transfers

#    Note:
#    For airtime purchases, the dialled string is of format "SHORTCODE*AMOUNT*11-digit-number" or "SHORTCODE*AMOUNT"
#    For Account transfers, the dialled string is of format "SHORTCODE*AMOUNT*10-digit-number"
